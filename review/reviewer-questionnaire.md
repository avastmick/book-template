You have been chosen as a reader of an early draft of *BOOK NAME*

Please answer the following questions, adding in as much information as possible. Ideally you will give locations in the book to relate to your answers.

If you are using a Kindle, please feel free to highlight and add notes that way. See my site for the details on how to do this.
